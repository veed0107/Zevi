The wishlist feature is a common tool on e-commerce websites that allows users to save products they're interested in for future reference or purchase. Users can add items to their wishlist while browsing, making it easier for them to revisit those products later without having to search for them again.

Overall, an e-commerce website like "Zevi" would aim to provide a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience for customers, offering them a wide range of products from various brands while incorporating useful features like search, filters, and wishlists to enhance usability and satisfaction.
